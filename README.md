### About
* [Why?](https://pluspora.com/posts/f61ba1c025c70137cf9f005056264835)
* ... also some shell laguage would have been better fit for the task, but I had an urge to code awk. Sorry.
* I have some hopes someone will implement something like this, but in C, Python or (ba)sh.

### TODO -list  
* Gather more information at the start and end of test(s) and warn user if something alarming is found.  
* Since test last longer the more capacity a disk has - make smaller disk count more towards total progress %.
